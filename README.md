# Nonthing is Non-Reuseable
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-by-developers.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)  [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-love.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src = "https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Solid waste&message=Management&color=green" height="30">

Garbage arising from human or animal activities, that is abandoned as unwanted and useless is referred as solid waste. Solid waste disposal must be managed systematically to ensure environmental best practices. Solid 
waste disposal and management is a critical aspect of environmental hygiene and it needs to 
be incorporated into environmental planning.

## About Us

**Our Environment is Our Responisbility.** We have keep it save and clean. Generally, it is generated from industrial, residential and commercial 
activities in a given area, and may be handled in a variety of ways.

*But is the whole garabage handled well ? Is it being recycled properly ? If it is done, why does we see garbage all around ?* 


The aim of our initiative is to provide a platform where the waste is being dumped or recycled properly, every waste collected from streets to highways and making sure that our environment is clean.


## Our Strategy

<img src="https://github.com/Monisha-23/Nothing-is-non-reusable/blob/main/strategy%20flowchart.jpg" height="500">

Our strategy works in step-wise manner for collecting waste from every corner of the city.

* **Home to Shopkeeper:** The daily garbage produced at houses and streets by the 
people are collected by volunteers, allocated to a particular area and approaches the 
shopkeeper to store them for further pickups. (Houses can send a request to their nearst shopkeeper to ask them to collect the garabge. And the amount of garbage collected from them is updated in their portal.)

* **Shopkeeper to Garbage Collector:** The shopkeeper collects all the garbage from 
the volunteer and stores it until a Garbage collector approaches that particular shop and collects it. Garbage collector’s workers approach and collect wastes from all the shopkeepers in a particular 
area to which he has been allocated and then pays for the garbage. Similarly as house sends request shopkpeer, shopkeeper sends request to their nearst garbagecollector.

* **Garbage Collector to Companies:** Garbage collectors separate the wastes collected 
from different areas into wet wastes, dry wastes, etc. And decides which wastes to sell and which 
wastes to burn or bury. The wastes which can be recycled are sent to the recycling companies and 
wet wastes which are capable of increasing land fertility are sent to nurseries/farms and bury or 
burn the rest. Companies will have direct contact with the Garbage Collector. Collecting the waste 
from shopkeepers and sending them to the respective companies is the responsibility of the 
Garbage collector and lastly Garbage collector will get paid by the Companies/nursery/farms for 
the amount of wastes they have collected from every shopkeeper of different areas and the financial 
update must be done in their portals.

* **Volunteer :** volunteers are hired by shopkpeer,garbage collector or companies to collect or seperate from the waste.

**Brownie Points**

✓ The aim of this website development is to manage the solid waste properly. So that there 
will be no segregated wastes at our streets and ultimately getting a clean environment out 
of it.

✓ At each and every step of the Garbage Collecting process every person will be benefited by 
selling garbage / buying /recycling or may be making their house clean.

✓ The main purpose of including volunteers in this process is to reduce the unemployment by 
creating part-time or full-time opportunities.
