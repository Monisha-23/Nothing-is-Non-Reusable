Garbage arising from human or animal activities, that is abandoned as unwanted and useless is referred as solid waste. Solid waste disposal must be managed systematically to ensure environmental best practices. Solid 
waste disposal and management is a critical aspect of environmental hygiene and it needs to 
be incorporated into environmental planning.

## About Us

**Our Environment is Our Responisbility.** We have keep it save and clean. Generally, it is generated from industrial, residential and commercial 
activities in a given area, and may be handled in a variety of ways.

*But is the whole garabage handled well ? Is it being recycled properly ? If it is done, why does we see garbage all around ?* 


The aim of our initiative is to provide a platform where the waste is being dumped or recycled properly, every waste collected from streets to highways and making sure that our environment is clean.
